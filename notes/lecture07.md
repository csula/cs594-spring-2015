We begin the class with the class with the screen shot below.

The discussion circles around the concept of a graph database.  Here we use Andreas Kollegger and Rik Van Bruggen's white paper [Graph Databases Mean Business)(http://neo4j.com/news/graph-databases-mean-business/)

See Robinson's [Graph Databases](http://info.neotechnology.com/rs/neotechnology/images/GraphDatabases.pdf) for more information.

We utilized two set of slides for this visualization.

1. [Visual Representation from Semiology of Graphics by J. Bertin](http://innovis.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/innovis/uploads/Courses/InformationVisualizationDetails/09Bertin.pdf).  Professor Carpendale provides insight in to an area that is somewhere between infographics and data visualization.

2. [CPSC 599.28/601.28 Social Visualization](http://innovis.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/innovis/uploads/Courses/InformationVisualizationDetails/SocialVis.pdf).  The focus here is on how to better represent graph relationship with visualization.

Finally, we wrapped the course up with [DZONE's 2014 Guide to Big Data](http://www.dzone.com/research/guide-to-big-data).
