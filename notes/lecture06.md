## Data Analytic

Population - entire dataset ~ N
Sample - subset of population ~ s 

* standard statistical analysis - s is small compared to N
* with "big data" (techniques) N is possible
-- Polical Sentiments: using tweets

Anecdotal Evidence
1. small sample size
2. selection bias
3. confirmation bias
4. inaccuracy

Basic Statistics Concept:
1. Mean
2. Standard Deviation
3. Mode
4. Median

Black Swan ~ outliers (exceptions that standard statistics don't apply)

cross-sectional study - a study that collects data about a population at a particular time.

longitudinal study - study one population over all time.

Distribution - 
1. Normal distribution
2. Log-Normal distribution
3. Gaussian distribution
4. Bimodal -- suggests something is not right
5. CDF - cummulative distribution percentile question

EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis
- trial and errors
- look for anomolies
- explore finding out more possible questions...

Detect similar faces in a crowd.  Let us take the example here: https://realpython.com/blog/python/face-recognition-with-python/

1. Extract facial image(s)
2. Extract features using PCA -- or similar techniques
3. Do dot product to calculate similarities
