# Lecture 01

Today's lecture we discussed some high-level topics.  In a nutshell, Big Data (for this class) is:

1. Acquire Data
2. Store Data
3. Analyze Data
4. Visualize Data

## Data Acquisition

There are many factors that one has to consider when acquiring data.  The most important is what domain does the data reside in.  It is definitely conceivable that data of interest might rest in multiple domains.  In which case, one must understand the domain(s) and adjust the acquisition methodology.

## Data Storage

Siloing data is not a trivial task, especially considering that the nature of our data is "Big" -- we toss the question out there: what is big?  In understanding the data size we can appropriately select the correct technology.

## Data Analysis

This is the heart of the course.  We have to come up with a strategy to analyze the data that we've acquired and derive knowledge.  For the purpose of this course we consider the order of knowledge:

* First order: obtaining information directly from the data or metadata

* Second order: derive inferential information

* Third order: predicting an outcome that is derived from data

## Data Visualization

The ultimate goal is to answer a question that is interesting about the data acquired.  Visualization tells the story about the data you've acquired and the analysis you've done on it.
