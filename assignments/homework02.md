# Homework 2

## Objective

The objective of this homework assignment is to have persist the acquired data.  One such way is to use a database of some sort.  While there are many "storage" options.  We focus for this homework assignment on two options:

1. Using a NOSQL storage technology. With this option your team will insert data into a NOSQL database.  Understandably the schema and format will change over time so it is not important to have the perfect collection definition. 

1. Using the HDFS storage technology.  You are free to store your data in plain text format.  However, to demonstrate 'scalability' your storage layer must be built on top of HDFS (using Spark or Hadoop).


## Demo & Presentation

Your team will present the storage layer technology to the instructor during class.  There is no need to do a class-demo.

## Grading Rubric

Your application will need to demonstrate insert and retrieve.
