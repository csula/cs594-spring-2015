# Homework 4

## Objective

The objective of this homework assignment is to perform data analytic, using the various methods we have discussed in class, on the data that you have collected.  There are two parts to assignment:

1. Your team will perform the standard statistic methods (mean, median, mode, and standard deviation) on your data.  Exactly which data to calculate is up to your team.  After all, you know your data better than anyone else.

2. Your team will need to develop your own analytic on the data.  The analytic should serve as supporting evidence that answers the question that your team has presented during the initial presentation.  

## Deliverable

Put together presentation consisting of 3 slides:

1. Restate your question (research objective) from the first presentation.  If your team needs to modify your initial question, please indicate so.

2. State how your team has calculated the statistic data *and* present your result.

3. Describe how your team has (or is planning to) perform the data analytic to answer the research question.  

## Demo & Presentation

Only one member of the team will need to upload the presentation.  Your team will have 3 minutes to present your slides.  I recommend that you alot 1 minute per slide and take turns to speak.

### Grading Rubric

Your team must have three slides for full credit; and the slides must address the task mentioned in the deliverable.
