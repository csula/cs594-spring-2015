# Homework 4

## Objective

The objective of this homework assignment is to demonstrate the visualization aspect of your project.  Simply put your visualization part is the telling of your data analytic result using graphs and plots.  Although I recommended using bootstrap's dash board, you are not required to use bootstrap.  

Your visualization must support the data analytic which supports or disproves your original research question.

The dashboard must include, at the mimimum, 2 plots/graphs.  One that tells the standard stastics analysis (part 1 from the previous homework) and one that supports your own data analytic portion (part 2 from the previous homework).

I recommend that you use EDA to discover new data and come up with a new angle to look at your data.

## Deliverable

Your team will present the visualization product and discuss this during the presention of the project.

## Demo & Presentation

Your team will demonstrate the presentation as part of the project demonstratio.

### Grading Rubric

Your grade will be base on the "quality" of the product.  Imagine if you were to deliver your product to the customer, is this an acceptable product or something that is toilet paper worthy.

Your grade will be based on a scale of 1 - 15. Note that very few teams will get an actual 15 point; most teams' visualization score will fall somewhere between 10 and 12.  It is possible to get a score of less than 5 if your product is simply 'ugly'.  Note that if your team only produces 2 plots, please do not expect more than 10 points.
