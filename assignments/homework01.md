# Homework 1

## Objective

The objectives of this assigment are to:

1. Identify a data domain that your team will explore
2. Write code to acquire a sample data set from that domain

## Deliverable

Your team will present your first homework assignment on 26 April 2015.

## Demo & Presentation

Each team will have a hard 3 minutes limit:
 
1. 1 Slide on the domain and interest (1 minute)
2. 1 Slide data acquisition methodology (1 minute)
3. Demonstration of the code and resulting data (1 minute)

I recommend that you practice before hand and be sure to have everything setup ready to go.  Let us avoid in class preparation. 

### Data Domain

The idea behind the data domain selection is that your team spend time doing research and discussion.  In addition to the domain background, your first slide must answer one (or more) of the following type of **How** or **Why** or **What if** questions.  Remember, we're not truly doing data science if we're simply answer the first order **What** questions.

### Acquisition Methodology

You should discuss how the data is acquired.  What method?  What technology?  What data clean up do you have to do?  It should be more than just `We use ___ software` or `We download this ___ url`.

### Coding Requirement

Output from your program can be saved to a plain text file or displayed to the screen/console.  Your code should absolutely trimmed down and only save the necessary information.  In other words, the console (or file) output should only contained tripped out information.  Do not download the entire page and leave HTML intact.  This is not considered data acquisition.

### Grading Rubric

1. Data Domain Relevancy: 5 points
2. Data Acquisition Methodology: 5 points
3. Code functional and output is "correct": 5 points

> We're doing ... Is this the right idea?

Are you answering one of the three types of questions from above?  How, Why or What if?  If so then yes.  Otherwise, not likely.

> So far we have not needed to write code to pull this data, although we will eventually code for cleaning up the data and modeling it for our cross domain recommender system. Will showing the data we've acquired be sufficient?

You will need to show code (automation).  You simply cannot click for your data.

> We also have idea of ___. We get ___ of some big organizations and doing some analysis on it as above.

I like the approach.  But you have to answer the 2nd order question.

> We are probably going to analyze which stock to buy or not by analyzing the up n down in the prices. Also if you have any idea to increase the complexity of analysis let us know.

As I've mentioned in class.  Doing stock analysis using big data is not trivial.  Your project, if focus on "technical analysis," is virtually impossible given the time constraint and will require complex mathematical background.  If you're planning to do "fundamental analysis" I might be ok with it.  However, I think that you will have a tough time because without a good question, the domain is  too broad.  Instead, I recommend that you focus on an aspect of fundamental analysis.  For example searching for news on companies and correlate positive news from negative news to market price.  Using this tool, you can predict the direction of a stock.

> i and my partner have made project on twitter is the topic good?

On the surface yes.  You can work with twitter data.  The bigger question remains, what data are you trying to uncover?  What is the underlying question?  Does it answer one of the three?

1. How __ ?
2. Why __ ?
3. What if __?

If your project meets the above criteria, then yes proceed..

> Is there any tool in python by which i can scrap data from html page.(just title) from the below link.?

I am sure there is one.  You'd need to do the research and find the right one.  This is part of the homework assignment.
