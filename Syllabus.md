# Big Data Analysis and Visualization

## Course Overview

- **Objective** This course will cover big data analysis and visualization and their foundation, principles, and elements.
- **Expectation** The class will include lectures on topics relating to big data technologies and on supplemental paper reading assignments.  Programming assignments will augment the theoretical aspects of big data.  Please understand that this is a graduate-level and upper-division engineering course.  As such, students are expected to devote a large amount of time to the programming assignments and course project.
